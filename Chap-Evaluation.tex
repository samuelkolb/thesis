Several experiments have been run in order to assess how well the implementation accomplishes the clause learning and clausal optimization tasks.
Moreover, the influence of different factors internal and external to the algorithm is evaluated.
The clause learning and clausal optimization workflows will be examined separately, in that order.

\section{Learning}

This section attempts to evaluate how well the clause learning system accomplishes the first goal of this thesis.
There are different aspects to be considered.
Firstly, the accuracy of the learned clauses will be examined, as well as the influence of several parameters on the accuracy.
This gives a measure of how well a learned theory approximates the underlying model.
Secondly, it will be evaluated how efficiently this task is accomplished.
Since clausal discovery can take a long time to find a theory on larger examples, it will be important to understand the influence of several factors on the running speed.
In the last part, the differences between learned clauses and constraints given by a user will be examined.

\subsection{Setup}
There are two key problems that are used to evaluate different questions.
Their standard setup will be described in this section.
Different experiments can vary on the specific examples and parameters that are used and it will be mentioned when this is the case.

\paragraph{Map coloring}
The map coloring problem has already been used as a running example in the previous section.
It also serves as a good, albeit small, example for clause learning in practice.
The standard setting uses two examples, each with three countries.
The first example (figure~\ref{fig:setup_mapcolor_benelux}) features two colors, while the second example (figure~\ref{fig:setup_mapcolor_benede}) needs three colors as all countries are connected.

\begin{figure}
\centering
\begin{minipage}{.5\textwidth}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[height=3.5cm]{MapColoringBenelux.pdf}
  \caption{Map coloring example 1}
  \label{fig:setup_mapcolor_benelux}
\end{minipage}%
\begin{minipage}{.5\textwidth}
  \centering
  \includegraphics[height=3.5cm]{MapColoringBenede.pdf}
  \caption{Map coloring example 2}
  \label{fig:setup_mapcolor_benede}
\end{minipage}
\end{figure}

Map coloring uses types $\mathit{Country}$ and $\mathit{Color}$.
It uses two predicates $\mathit{color/2}$ and $\mathit{neighbor/2}$, the neighbor predicate is symmetric.
Unless mentioned otherwise, the standard parameters for map coloring are $3$ variables and~$3$ terms per clause.

\paragraph{Sudoku}
Sudoku is a slightly more difficult problem.
An $n \times n$ sudoku contains $n$ rows, $n$ columns and $n$ blocks, each of which contains the numbers $1$ to $n$ exactly once.
Every cell is represented by an object of type $\mathit{Cell}$.
The other types describe attributes of cells: $\mathit{Row}$, $\mathit{Colum}$, $\mathit{Block}$ and a numeric type $\mathit{Value}$.
Each of those attributes is related to a cell through the predicates $\mathit{row/2}$, $\mathit{col/2}$, $\mathit{block/2}$ and $\mathit{value/2}$ respectively.
In the standard setting one $4 \times 4$ example (figure~\ref{fig:setup_sudoku}) is provided.

\begin{figure}[!htp]
	\centering
	\begin{tabular}{|cc|cc|}
		\hline
		1 & 3 & 2 & 4 \\
		4 & 2 & 3 & 1 \\ \hline
		2 & 1 & 4 & 3 \\
		3 & 4 & 1 & 2 \\ \hline
	\end{tabular}
	\label{fig:setup_sudoku}
	\caption{$4 \times 4$ sudoku example}
\end{figure}

Clause learning on the sudoku is usually done with $4$ variables and~$4$ terms per clause.
In the example, the row, column, block and value are explicitly given for each cell.
The use of specific, disjoint types instead of one common (numeric) type for rows, columns and blocks makes the clause learning process more efficient.
It prevents the use of the same variable for, for example, a row and a column.

\paragraph{Elevator}

\paragraph{Co-housing}
The co-housing problem is a somewhat more complex problem.
Two friends (persons) are looking at different situations (areas) to live and work in.
\\\\
\begin{minipage}{0.5\textwidth}
	\begin{verbatim*}
		type Area
		type Person
		type Cost > nat

		calc cheap(Cost)
	\end{verbatim*}
\end{minipage}
\begin{minipage}{0.5\textwidth}
	\begin{verbatim*}
		pred live(Person, Area)
		pred work(Person, Area)
		pred car(Person)

		pred cost(Area, Cost)
	\end{verbatim*}
\end{minipage}

Background knowledge is used to calculate what is considered as cheap. It also limits the amount of people to $2$ and expresses that every area has only one cost. There are $5$~examples that each adhere to $4$~constraints:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item If the two persons do not live in the same area, they work in the same area.
	\item If a person does not work and live in the same area, that person needs a car.
	\item A person who lives in a cheap area has a car
	\item If the two persons live together, they live in an expensive area.
\end{enumerate}

% - N Dependent of size / number of examples

\subsection{Speed}

Unless explicitly stated, all problems are run $8$ consecutive times in order to eliminate external influences.
The experiments are run on the same machine\footnote{Mac OSX, 2.3 GHz Intel Core i7 with 4 cores and hyper threading, 16GB RAM}.

\begin{question}
	How fast is the clause learning system?
\end{question}

\begin{experiment}
	In order to gain an overview over the running times and provide a benchmark for tests on various influences, the standard examples are each run using the standard clause learning process.

\begin{question}
	How do the syntactic restrictions influence the running time?
\end{question}

\begin{experiment}[\textsc{Range restriction}]
	The clause learning algorithm normally only explores range restricted clauses.
	While this measure positively influences the efficiency of the algorithm, it trades off expressiveness.
	In this experiment the standard problems are run, while allowing lifting the constraint that clauses must be range restricted.

\paragraph{Discussion}
"Discuss"

\begin{question}
	What is the influence of the efficiency measures on the running time?
\end{question}

There are mainly two measures incorporated in the clause learning algorithm that aim to reduce the running time.
Contrary to syntactic restrictions these do, in principle, not affect the outcome of the algorithm.

\begin{experiment}[\textsc{Symmetric predicates}]
	The first design choice evaluated is the option to provide symmetric predicates.
	The map coloring example contains a symmetric predicate $\mathit{neighbor}$.
	By replacing this symmetric predicate with a standard predicate, the influence on the running time can be measured.

	\begin{table}[!htp]
		\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{XXX}
			\textbf{Name}	& \textbf{Mean (s)}	& \textbf{StdDev (s)} \\
			\toprule
			Standard & 1.581 & 0.117 \\
			Non-symmetric & 2.541 & 0.128 \\
		\end{tabularx}
		\label{tbl:exp_speed_symm}
		\caption{Running times symmetric vs. non-symmetric map coloring}
	\end{table}

	By running the non-symmetric version $8$ times, it can be compared to the standard map coloring problem.
	In the non-symmetric version an additional constraint is learned to express the symmetry of the neighbor relation: \cen{$\mathit{neighbor}(c_2, c_1) \leftarrow \mathit{neighbor}(c_1, c_2)$.}
\end{experiment}

\begin{experiment}[\textsc{Subset test}]
	As mentioned in chapter~\ref{cha:meth}, a subset test is used to forestall some entailment tests.
	In this experiment, the running times without subset test is measured to evaluate the effect of this test.
	To this end, the standard problems are run without the subset test.

	\begin{table}[!htp]
		\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{XXX}
			\textbf{Name}	& \textbf{Mean (s)}	& \textbf{StdDev (s)} \\
			\toprule
			Map coloring 	& 1.558				& 0.117 \\
			Sudoku 			& 5.239				& 0.140 \\
			Elevator 		& 3.678 			& 0.094 \\
			Co-housing 		& 30.145			& 0.159
		\end{tabularx}
		\label{tbl:exp_speed_standard}
		\caption{Running times for standard examples without subset test}
	\end{table}
\end{experiment}

\begin{experiment}[\textsc{Representative test}]
	The same constraint can often be represented by multiple clauses.
	In order to avoid generating different clauses but equivalent, the refinement operator defines an order of clauses.
	If a clause cannot be rewritten as a different clause that occurs earlier in that order, the clause is called representative.
	This measure leads to a reduction of generated clauses.
	In this experiment the standard problems are run without this test.

	\begin{table}[!htp]
		\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{XXX}
			\textbf{Name}	& \textbf{Mean (s)}	& \textbf{StdDev (s)} \\
			\toprule
			Map coloring 	& 2.389				& 0.130 \\
			Sudoku 			& 8.995				& 0.125 \\

\section{Optimization}
This section examines how well the second goal of the thesis, the learning of optimization criteria, has been accomplished.
Contrary to the previous section, the evaluation will focus only on the accuracy with which the learned soft constraints are able to approximate an underlying model.
Different factors will be explored that influence the results of the clausal optimization system.

\subsection{Setup}

\paragraph{Housing}
The primary example for clausal optimization revolves around housing.
There are three areas ($A_1$, $A_2$ and $A_3$) which have certain characteristics such as whether the area has a low crime rate and is cheap to live in.
In this example the user is trying to decide 1) where to live, 2) where to work and 3) which school to select.
Any area can be chosen for living and all areas have a school.
The areas to work in are restricted by the job offers that have been received.

\begin{table}[!htp]
	\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{l|r||*3{>{\centering\arraybackslash}X}}
	    & \textbf{Category} & \textbf{Area 1} & \textbf{Area 2} & \textbf{Area 3} \\
	    \midrule
	    \textbf{Properties} & Low crime & x & x & \\
	    & Cheap & x & & x \\
	    \midrule
	    \textbf{Possible} & House & x & x & x \\
	    \textbf{locations} & Job offer & x & x & \\
	    & School & x & x & x 
	\end{tabularx}
	\label{tbl:setup_housing}
	\caption{Characteristics and restrictions}
\end{table}

The different possible choices form $18$ distinct examples.
Using variables $x, y$ and~$z$ to denote the selected living, work and school areas, respectively, a template example can be formulated as:

\begin{figure}[!htp]
	\begin{minipage}{0.5\textwidth}
		\begin{verbatim*}
			const Area A1 A2
			const Area A3 A4

			low_crime(A1)
			low_crime(A2)
			low_crime(A4)
		\end{verbatim*}
	\end{minipage}
	\begin{minipage}{0.5\textwidth}
		\begin{verbatim*}
			cheap(A1)
			cheap(A3)

			live_in(x)
			work_in(z)
			school_in(y)
		\end{verbatim*}
	\end{minipage}
	\label{fig:setup_housing_example_template}
	\caption{Housing example template}
\end{figure}

In order to emulate real user preferences, a model is used used to generate pair wise rankings over the examples.
The standard model consists of $4$ weighted constraints:
\begin{shiftedflalign*}
	& \text{ }0.50 : \mathit{low\_crime}(a) \leftarrow \mathit{live\_in}(a) & \\
	& \text{ }0.25 : \mathit{school\_in}(a) \leftarrow \mathit{work\_in}(a) & \\
	& \text{ }1.00 : \mathit{low\_crime}(a) \leftarrow \mathit{school\_in}(a) & \\
	& \text{-}1.00 : \mathit{false} \leftarrow \mathit{live\_in}(a) \land \mathit{cheap}(a) &
\end{shiftedflalign*}
