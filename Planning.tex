	\item[Evaluation: Until beginning of February] Some aspects of the implementation have to be polished yet, then I will evaluate how clausal discovery performs for constraint learning. First I will use small problems (e.g. graph coloring) and see if the learned constraints are usable in general. Afterwards I will look more at what problems others solve to be able to compare.
	\item[Research: Until beginning of March] Look at optimization. Different possibilities: find minimization theory for IDP, assign weights to predicates (more MAX-SAT and/or Passerini), or find a broader function. The latter two will have to be examined in terms of solving, the first one can be done in the exisiting setup with IDP.
	\item[Implementation: Until beginning of April] Implement the optimization.
	\item[Evaluation: Until mid May] Evaluating the optimization

End january and during the research phase I will also focus on writing. In the beginning of april I will also work on the poster to present the approach. Afterwards, again, there will be writing until the end. I will only work on the presentation after the deadline.
